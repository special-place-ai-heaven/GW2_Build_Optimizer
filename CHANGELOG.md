# Changelog

All notable changes to GW2 Build Optimizer are documented here.

## 1.4.18 - 2026-08-23

This release replaces several optimistic stat assumptions with sourced, mode-aware character-sheet rules. Its first priority is trust: values shown as attributes should be values a player can reproduce in Guild Wars 2, while modeled rotation output is identified separately.

### Player-visible stat presentation

- The Stats pane now leads with the nine level-80 Hero-panel attributes: Power, Precision, Toughness, Vitality, Condition Damage, Expertise, Concentration, Ferocity, and Healing Power.
- Health and Armor remain visible derived Hero-panel values.
- Removed synthetic `Effective Power`, `Effective HP`, and `Healing Index` from the primary comparison. Those internal scoring aids are not character-sheet attributes and should not look like in-game values.
- Removed the synthetic three-scenario damage table from the primary attribute comparison. Rotation output remains labeled as a simulation rather than a live combat record.
- Boons, conditions, cleanses, stability, skill use, and viability remain separated from passive attributes so temporary effects are not presented as permanent gear stats.

### Permanent attribute corrections

- Tooltip coefficients no longer become permanent attributes. This fixes values such as barrier amounts, direct healing amounts, life-siphon damage, and life-siphon healing being added to Power or Healing Power.
- The same permanent-stat rule is shared by character-sheet calculation, synergy extraction, and the optimizer's LLM tool data. A tooltip amount can no longer disappear from the UI while still biasing candidate selection through another parser.
- Conditional named adjustments such as `Additional Power` are excluded from the unbuffed panel. They belong to timed activation modeling.
- Trait `BuffConversion` facts remain supported. For example, Wellspring's Power-to-Healing-Power conversion still changes the visible passive result.

### Game-mode corrections

- Known duplicated `AttributeAdjust` rows are resolved by trait, target attribute, and selected game mode rather than being summed.
- Lingering Magic now contributes 240 Concentration in PvE and 120 in PvP/WvW, instead of adding both API rows.
- Known conditional or pet-only duplicated rows are excluded from the standing player panel.
- Unknown duplicated rows are omitted instead of guessed. Missing data is safer than a confidently inflated attribute.
- Percentage tooltip facts now share one classifier between combat and synergy parsing.
- Tooltip-only 100% critical-chance facts, recharge reductions, incoming-damage reductions, and other defensive percentages no longer become outgoing damage multipliers.
- Two-value percentage pairs within one trait collapse to one mode value instead of stacking simultaneously. Conditional timing remains provisional and is handled separately from the passive panel.

### Equipment corrections

- Only the active land weapon set's two sigils contribute to the standing stat/modifier calculation. The second set is reserved for weapon-swap timeline handling.
- Rune tier bonuses continue to be summed from all six equipped tiers.
- Level-80 base attributes remain 1,000 for Power, Precision, Toughness, and Vitality, and 0 for the five secondary attributes.

### Profession and armor baselines

The optimizer uses separate sourced profession health and ascended-armor defense values:

| Baseline | Value | Professions |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| High base health | 9,212 | Warrior, Necromancer |
| Medium base health | 5,922 | Revenant, Engineer, Ranger, Mesmer |
| Low base health | 1,645 | Guardian, Thief, Elementalist |
| Heavy armor defense | 1,271 | Warrior, Guardian, Revenant |
| Medium armor defense | 1,118 | Engineer, Ranger, Thief |
| Light armor defense | 967 | Elementalist, Mesmer, Necromancer |

Visible Health is `profession base health + 10 × Vitality`. Visible Armor is `armor-set defense + Toughness`. Armor weight does not change the attribute budget of an otherwise identical armor prefix.

### Reproduced failure and corrected result

The original Ranger case reached 7,156 Power and 13,696 Healing Power because effect coefficients were treated as passive stats. The exact offending tooltip amounts were removed from every permanent-stat consumer.

The cached WvW reproduction now resolves the tested optimized candidate to:

| Attribute | Value | Exact source |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Power | 3,058 | level-80 base + Strong ascended gear + six Rune of Infiltration tiers |
| Precision | 2,544 | level-80 base + Strong ascended gear + six Rune of Infiltration tiers |
| Toughness | 1,000 | level-80 base |
| Vitality | 1,240 | level-80 base + Natural Fortitude |
| Concentration | 120 | Lingering Magic, WvW value |
| Healing Power | 214 | Wellspring: 7% of 3,058 Power, rounded for display |

The Rune of Infiltration contribution is exactly +175 Power and +225 Precision from its six API bonus lines.

### Validation

- All optimizer tests pass: 735 passed, 1 network test ignored.
- All 39 math permutation tests pass.
- All 29 objective-profile integration tests pass.
- Addon compilation passes.
- Clippy completes successfully; existing repository warnings remain non-blocking.

### Known boundaries

- Rotation output is still a model, not a live combat log. It remains labeled as simulated.
- Conditional trait and upgrade effects require timeline activation rules before their contribution can be called exact.
- A shield's separate defense rating is not yet added to the optimized Hero-panel Armor value. The armor-weight baseline itself is exact.
- Food, utility consumables, temporary boons, and triggered upgrade effects are intentionally not folded into the unbuffed attribute table.
